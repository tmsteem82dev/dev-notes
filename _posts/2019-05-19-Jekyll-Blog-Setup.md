I'm currently experimenting with jekyll for creating a blog using github. 
I have a habit of taking notes while I'm studying / learning a subject and I was looking for a place where I can store and easily access my notes.
Another thing I wanted, was to write my notes in Markdown. Which is easy and fast and allows for styling and code snippets. 

I thought that using a blog would be interesting for note keeping and see what grows from there.

## Jekyll

Jekyll seemed simple and easy to setup, in other words perfect for a quick test. So far I really enjoy using it.
Even though I am still learning to use Jekyll, I cam already see it offers many of the features I am looking for.

## Setup

Setup instructions are very easy. Everything you need to know is in the [Jekyll Now repository README.md](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)

I highly recommend installing the tools and libraries to edit and run the blog you're building with Jekyll locally.

## Notes
* Had to install ruby first.
* Installed github gems?

Simply run {% highlight bash %}jekyll serve 
{% endhighlight %} to run the blog
