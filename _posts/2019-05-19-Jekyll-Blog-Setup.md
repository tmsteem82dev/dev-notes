I'm currently experimenting with jekyll for creating a blog using github as well. 
I have a habit of taking notes while I'm studying / learning a subject and I was looking for a place where I can story and easily access my notes.
Another thing I wanted was to write my notes in Markdown. Which is easy and fast and allows for styling and code snippets. 

I thought that using a blog would be interesting for note keeping and see what grows from there.

## Jekyll

Jekyll seemed simple and easy to setup, in other words perfect for a quick test. So far I'm really enjoy using it.
I am still learning what I can do with it and even now it offers more than enough of what I was looking for.
